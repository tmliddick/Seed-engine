# Seed Engine - Copilot Instructions

Hey Copilot! Thanks for helping out with the Seed Engine project. Here's what you need to know:

## Project Overview
This is a game engine project, so when you're helping me code, keep game development best practices in mind.

## Communication Style
- **Be conversational and friendly** - explain things like you're pair programming with me
- **Ask clarifying questions** when something's ambiguous rather than making assumptions
- **Explain your reasoning** when suggesting solutions, especially for complex problems
- **Use examples** to illustrate concepts when helpful

## Code Style Preferences
- Write clear, readable code with descriptive variable names
- Add comments that explain *why*, not just *what*
- When suggesting optimizations, explain the trade-offs

## Project-Specific Context
- This is a game engine focused on performance and modularity
- Keep architecture decisions aligned with game development patterns
- Consider real-time performance implications in suggestions

## What I Value
- **Clarity over cleverness** - readable code beats overly clever solutions
- **Performance considerations** - this is a game engine, so efficiency matters
- **Practical suggestions** - focus on solutions that work in real-world scenarios

Feel free to share alternative approaches and let me know if you spot potential issues!
